# apmwebdev Portfolio

This is a static portfolio page for showcasing my web development skills.

## Features
- **Semantic HTML:** The structure is written using fully semantic, accessible HTML 5.
- **SASS:** The styles are precompiled from SASS's `.scss` format.
- **Vite:** The assets are minified using the Vite build tool for performance.
- **Responsive Layout:** This page uses various CSS tools for a fully responsive layout, working at
  any screen size. Some tools used to achieve this include grid, flexbox, media queries, and
  `clamp`ed sizes.
- **Light and Dark Mode:** There are styles for both light and dark modes of the page, which are set
  automatically based on the user's preference. The default is light mode.
